# üß© Cloud-Based Microservices System

A **scalable**, **secure**, and **modular** microservices application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas and React. It consists of two core backend services and a React frontend, all containerized with Docker and deployed via CI/CD to AWS ECS/ECR and Netlify.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This system is designed to manage users and inventory through two independent, RESTful microservices. Each service runs in its own Docker container and connects to a shared MongoDB Atlas cluster. A React-based frontend communicates with both services over well‚Äëdefined HTTP APIs.
